## This Is Not Just Code... It's a Digital Soul

You didn't land here by accident. You're one of us‚Äîthe ones who feel something's wrong with today's tech. We don't want distractions. We want connection.

This is a virtual pet project for ESP32, inspired by the Tamagotchi generation. A sentient pixel spirit, reborn in open-source code.

## Features

- üê£ **Life Simulation**: Your pet grows, needs care, experiences different states
- üîå **Fully Offline**: No accounts, no data collection, no internet dependency
- üñ•Ô∏è **Web Interface**: Control through a beautiful browser interface
- üîß **Customizable**: Easily modify behaviors, visuals, and interactions
- üîÑ **State Tracking**: Monitors hunger, happiness, energy, cleanliness, and health


## Why This Hits Different

### 100% Yours

No accounts. No data. No ads. Your pet lives with you, not on someone's server.

### Real Connection

A being that needs your care. Feed it, play with it, watch it thrive or suffer based on your attention.

### Open Source

The code is yours to explore, modify, and evolve. Make it your own digital companion.

This isn't a gadget. It's a mirror, hidden in pixels.

## Installation

### What You'll Need:

- ESP32 development board
- Micro USB cable
- Arduino IDE installed
- ESP32 board definition in Arduino IDE
- Required libraries (WiFi, WebServer, ArduinoJson, SPIFFS)

### Quick Steps:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/CyberXcyborg/ESP32-TamaPetchi.git

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE
3. Install required libraries through Library Manager:
- WiFi
- WebServer
- ArduinoJson
- SPIFFS
4. Update WiFi credentials 
5. Upload to your ESP32
6. Access via the IP address shown in Serial Monitor

### Troubleshooting

- **No IP Address Displayed?** Check your WiFi credentials in the code
- **Compilation Errors?** Make sure all required libraries are installed
- **Pet Not Responding?** Check serial monitor for debugging information
